Some key points to remember

## How to configure GitHub in your terminal:-

i. Configure your account in the terminal 

    git config --global user.email "username@email.com"
    git config --global user.name "GitHubUsername"

ii. Always check from which account you are pushing your codes, check it using command
    git config user.email
    git config user.name

1. if you want to push those changes in your desired github repository, follow these simple steps below:
2. make changes in the codebase

a. initialize your directory with git
    --> git init

b. stage the file(s) you want to push
    --> git add fileName.exe

c. commit those changes
    --> git commit -m "write some comment here"

d. go to your branch/ switch to your specified branch
    --> git branch -M main
    (here branch is 'main')

e. add repository as the remote origin you are pusing to, i.e., target repository URL
    --> git remote add origin https://github.com/GitHubUserName/RepositoryName.git
    (here you use your own target GitHub URL)

f. now push the staged file to the repository
    --> git push -u origin main
    (Note: you need to write the whole command for once. 
    Later on pushing to the same repository you don't need to do that. You can acheive the same using command --> git push)
